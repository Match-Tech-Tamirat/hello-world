## Working using the GitHub Flow

On this page, you will learn how to get the best out of working with GitHub.

The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub. It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

The GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab flow works like this:

1. **Create a New Branch**
    - Branching is the key concept in Git. And it works around the rule that the master branch is ALWAYS deployable.
    - That means, if you want to try something new or experiment, you create a new branch! Branching gives you an environment where you can make changes without affecting the main branch.
    - When your new branch is ready, it can be reviewed, discussed, and merged with the main branch when ready.
    - When you make a new branch, you will (almost always) want to make it from the master branch.
    - Note: Keep in mind that you are working with others. Using descriptive names for new branches, so everyone can understand what is happening.

2. **Make Changes and Add Commits**
    - After the new branch is created, it is time to get to work. Make changes by adding, editing, and deleting files. Whenever you reach a small milestone, add the changes to your branch by commit.
    - Adding commits keeps track of your work. Each commit should have a message explaining what has changed and why. Each commit becomes a part of the history of the branch, and a point you can revert back to if you need to.
    - Note: commit messages are very important! Let everyone know what has changed and why. Messages and comments make it so much easier for yourself and other people to keep track of changes.

3. **Open a Pull Request**
    - Pull requests are a key part of GitHub. A Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready for them to consider or review.
    - You can ask others to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.

4. **Review**
    - When a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch. This is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.
    - Pull Requests are designed to allow people to work together easily and produce better results together!
    - If you receive feedback and continue to improve your changes, you can push your changes with new commits, making further reviews possible.
    - Note: GitHub shows new commit and feedback in the "unified Pull Request view".

5. **Deploy**
    - When the pull request has been reviewed and everything looks good, it is time for the final testing. GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging with the master branch.
    - If any issues arise, you can undo the changes by deploying the master branch into production again!
    - Note: Teams often have dedicated testing environments used for deploying branches.

6. **Merge**
    - After exhaustive testing, you can merge the code into the master branch!
    - Pull Requests keep records of changes to your code, and if you commented and named changes well, you can go back and understand why changes and decisions were made.
    - Note: You can add keywords to your pull request for easier searching!

# Working with the Bitbucket Flow

The Bitbucket Flow is a workflow designed to work seamlessly with Git and Bitbucket, focusing on simplicity, collaboration, and continuous delivery. Here's how it works:

## Create a New Branch

- Branching is a central concept in Bitbucket Flow. The main branch (often named `main` or `master`) is always deployable.
- To work on new features or fixes, create a new branch from the default branch.

## Make Changes and Add Commits

- After creating a branch, make changes by adding, editing, and deleting files.
- Commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages explaining what was done.

## Push Changes to Bitbucket

- Push your branch and commits to the Bitbucket repository. This makes your changes accessible to the team.

## Create a Pull Request (PR)

- In Bitbucket, equivalent to a GitHub or GitLab Merge Request is a Pull Request.
- Open a PR to notify your team that you have changes ready for review and integration.
- Assign reviewers and add a description explaining the changes.

## Review and Discuss

- Collaborators review the PR, and discussions or comments are made to ensure code quality.
- Iterate on the code based on feedback, making additional commits as needed.

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

- Bitbucket integrates with CI/CD pipelines, so your changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed in response to the PR.
- Ensure all tests pass, and the code meets quality standards.

## Approve and Merge

- Once the PR passes review and CI/CD tests, it can be approved and merged into the default branch.
- Bitbucket tracks changes, comments, and discussions, making it easy to understand why decisions were made.

## Deployment

- After merging, Bitbucket can trigger deployment processes to deploy the changes to production or other environments.
- Monitor the deployment for any issues and roll back if necessary.

## Cleanup

- Delete the feature branch if it's no longer needed.
- Keep the default branch clean and always deployable.

## Documentation and Reporting

- Update project documentation and release notes as needed.
- Bitbucket provides reporting tools to track project progress and performance.

## Automated Testing and Monitoring

- Continuously monitor the application in production and run automated tests to catch regressions.

## Collaboration and Communication

- Use Bitbucket's collaboration features like code discussions, issue tracking, and project boards to keep the team aligned.

The Bitbucket Flow offers a straightforward and efficient development and deployment process. It encourages collaboration, automation, and documentation to deliver high-quality software effectively, similar to GitLab and GitHub flows.



# Working with the GitLab Flow

The GitLab Flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitLab, focusing on collaboration, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Here's how it works:

## Create a New Branch

- Branching is fundamental in GitLab Flow. The default branch (usually named `main` or `master`) is always deployable.
- To work on new features or fixes, create a new branch from the default branch.

## Make Changes and Add Commits

- After creating a branch, make changes by adding, editing, and deleting files.
- Commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages explaining what was done.

## Push Changes to GitLab

- Push your branch and commits to the GitLab repository. This makes your changes accessible to the team.

## Create a Merge Request (MR)

- GitLab's equivalent of a pull request is called a Merge Request.
- Open an MR to notify your team that you have changes ready for review and integration.
- Assign reviewers and add a description explaining the changes.

## Review and Discuss

- Collaborators review the MR, and discussions or comments are made to ensure code quality.
- Iterate on the code based on feedback, making additional commits as needed.

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

- GitLab integrates with CI/CD pipelines, so your changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed in response to the MR.
- Ensure all tests pass and the code meets quality standards.

## Approve and Merge

- Once the MR passes review and CI/CD tests, it can be approved and merged into the default branch.
- GitLab tracks changes, comments, and discussions, making it easy to understand why decisions were made.

## Deployment

- After merging, GitLab can trigger deployment processes to deploy the changes to production or other environments.
- Monitor the deployment for any issues and roll back if necessary.

## Cleanup

- Delete the feature branch if it's no longer needed.
- Keep the default branch clean and always deployable.

## Documentation and Reporting

- Update project documentation and release notes as needed.
- GitLab provides reporting tools to track project progress and performance.

## Automated Testing and Monitoring

- Continuously monitor the application in production and run automated tests to catch regressions.

## Collaboration and Communication

- Use GitLab's collaboration features like code discussions, issue tracking, and project boards to keep the team aligned.

The GitLab Flow is especially well-suited for teams looking for a streamlined development and deployment process with strong CI/CD integration. It encourages collaboration, automation, and documentation to deliver high-quality software efficiently.
